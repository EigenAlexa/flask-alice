#Uploading Code to AWS Lambda
To upload code to an AWS lambda function use the upload.sh script. To run the script run: `./upload.sh <SKILL_DIR> <FUNC_NAME>`, where SKILL_DIR is the directory which contains the index.js of the skill, and FUNC_NAME is the name of the AWS lambda function you want to upload the code to.
